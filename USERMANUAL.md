# Kitzy’s personal user manual

*Because people don’t come with instruction booklets (but wouldn’t it be easier if they did?). This is mine. It’s here to help you understand how I tick, how I work best, and how we can collaborate without stepping on rakes together.*

## Who I am
I’m a mix of big-heartedness, curiosity, and creativity. My Enneagram results put me as:  
- **Type 2 (Helper):** Warm, caring, people-oriented. I want to support others and make the team feel like a safe, connected place.  
- **Type 7 (Enthusiast):** Energetic, curious, and idea-hungry. I thrive on variety and love chasing possibilities.  
- **Type 4 (Individualist):** Authentic, creative, and reflective. I bring depth and individuality, sometimes with a flair of moodiness.  

I’m also **[AuDHD](https://embrace-autism.com/an-introduction-to-audhd/) (autism + ADHD)**, which colors how I think and work:  
- I usually have about seven trains of thought running at once, sometimes in different directions, sometimes colliding in a glorious mental pile-up.  
- Time blindness is real. If I’m late to a meeting, I didn’t forget you—I just fell down a rabbit hole. A quick ping is like tossing me a rope.  
- I sometimes interrupt because I think I can already see where you’re going, but I’m learning to hit pause and let people land their sentences.  
- Also, did anyone see where I left my AirPods? No, seriously.

## My values
- **Empathy as a baseline:** I believe life is better when people look out for each other. Thoughtfulness and small acts of care go a long way with me.  
- **Curiosity first:** I’d rather ask questions and explore possibilities than pretend to know everything. For me, curiosity is the gateway to clarity.  
- **Authenticity over polish:** I’d rather things be real and imperfect than fake and shiny. I value honesty and transparency, even when the truth is messy.  
- **Growth and learning:** Mistakes happen; what matters is taking responsibility, adapting, and improving. I’ll own my work and my missteps, and I appreciate when others do too.  
- **Playfulness:** Humor and lightness make hard work more sustainable. I believe we can take our work seriously without taking *ourselves* too seriously.

## How I work best
- I get inspired at odd hours. If I message you at midnight, that’s just the hamster in my brain choosing to sprint on the wheel. Please don’t feel pressure to respond outside your normal hours.  
- Collaboration fuels me. I’m happiest when I can bounce ideas around like mental ping-pong.  
- Variety keeps me energized. Give me a buffet of tasks, and I’ll happily graze.  
- Clear priorities help me focus. Otherwise I may try to juggle flaming torches *and* chainsaws simultaneously.

## How to communicate with me
- **Be clear and kind.** I love warmth, but I also need straightforwardness.  
- **Explicit is better than implicit.** Subtle hints often sneak right past me.  
- **Quick check-ins help.** A simple “just confirming you’re good with this?” is magic.  
- **Ping me if I’m late.** Think of it as tapping me on the shoulder in the time-fog.

## Things to know about me
- I sometimes overcommit because my enthusiasm writes checks my calendar can’t cash. A reminder to pace myself is always welcome.  
- I can get so busy helping others that I forget to drink water or breathe. Gentle nudges to take care of myself are appreciated.  
- My brain alternates between hyperfocus (deep in the matrix) and scatter (every shiny thing is suddenly fascinating). Both are normal settings for me.  
- Authenticity matters to me. If something’s off, just tell me. I’ll take honesty over guesswork any day.

## How to support me
- **Watch for signals.** If I get snappy, bossy, or perfectionistic, I’m probably feeling unappreciated or overloaded. A little acknowledgment helps more than you’d think.  
- **Remind me of boundaries.** Sometimes I try to be everyone’s emotional support human. Remind me it’s okay to step back.  
- **Anchor me in priorities.** When stress hits, my inner Type 7 scatters like confetti. Help me pick up the right piece first.  
- **Allow my moods.** My Type 4 side sometimes goes “moody indie soundtrack.” I don’t need fixing—just space.  
- **Humor works.** A well-timed joke resets me better than a motivational poster ever could.

## How I like to receive feedback
- **Direct is best.** I don’t do well with vague hints. If something’s off, say it plainly.  
- **Kindness matters.** I’m open to constructive criticism, but I’ll absorb it more easily if it’s framed with care.  
- **Timely > perfect.** Don’t wait weeks to craft the perfect message, tell me soon while it’s fresh and actionable.  
- **Private first, public later.** Critical feedback lands best in private. Positive feedback can be anywhere (and I’ll probably beam like a proud raccoon).  
- **Pair it with clarity.** If you can, include specific examples or suggestions. Otherwise my brain may spiral trying to fill in the blanks.  

---

## What I value in coworkers
- Authenticity and honesty (yes, even blunt honesty).  
- Thoughtfulness—small kindnesses land big with me.  
- Curiosity and playfulness—problem-solving doesn’t have to be boring.  
- Respect for different rhythms and quirks—neurodivergence is part of the team, not a bug.
